!=====In-Progress=====
#Hack:
	-- SQL Injection Protection

#Bug:
	-- When account creates new task and if then account will be deleted then
	-- his tasks are still stayed in the database. Fix it.

#Perhaps:
	-- Create db_creator.sh running db_creator.py

#Add:
	-- Write documentation and explain project's file structure and classes
	-- Write LICENSE

#Rewrite:
	-- Rewrite Tasks.execute_command() (bind method with self.commands)
	-- Remove Accounts.delete_tasks_of_another_account and make a
	-- universal method to delete all tasks of given account (rewrite Tasks.delete)
	-- and part of app.py that works with that function

#Change:
    -- install_requirements.sh -> setup.py. install setuptools

!=====Now=====
@Working-at-the-moment:


!=====Done=====
#Bug:
-- :rmacc command from app.py. It doesn't remove account

#Add:
-- Accounts (feature)
-- Deny guest account deletion

#Change:
-- Now main (origin) variable storing current_account_id is in Tasks
-- class. I should store it in Accounts class. But after changing location
-- of this variable I must modifie Accounts' & Tasks' methods

#Rewrite:
-- Make the :lsaccs show on which account the user
-- is currently (mark in green)

#Hack:
-- SQL Injection Protection {for some reason it is impossible to make sql injection
-- so i do not need to write sql injection protection. it is already here}
