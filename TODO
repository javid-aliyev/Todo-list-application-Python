#Hack:
	-- SQL Injection Protection

#Bug:
	-- :rmacc command from app.py. It doesn't remove account

#Perhaps:
	-- create db_creator.sh running db_creator.py

#Add:
	-- write documentation and explain project's file structure and classes
	-- write LICENSE
	-- accounts (feature)

#Rewrite:
	-- rewrite Tasks.execute_command() (bind method with self.commands)

@Working-at-the-moment:
	-- Add.accounts (feature)
	-- Bug.:rmacc command from app.py. It doesn't remove account
