!=====In-Progress=====
#Hack:
	-- SQL Injection Protection

#Bug:
	-- When account creates new task and if then account will be deleted then
	-- his tasks are still stayed in the database. Fix it.

#Perhaps:
	-- create db_creator.sh running db_creator.py

#Add:
	-- write documentation and explain project's file structure and classes

	-- write LICENSE

#Rewrite:
	-- rewrite Tasks.execute_command() (bind method with self.commands)

#Change:


!=====Now=====
@Working-at-the-moment:


!=====Done=====
#Bug:
-- :rmacc command from app.py. It doesn't remove account

#Add:
-- accounts (feature)

#Change:
-- now main (origin) variable is storing current_account_id in Tasks
-- class. I should store it in Accounts class. But after changing location
-- of this variable I should modifie Accounts' & Tasks' methods
